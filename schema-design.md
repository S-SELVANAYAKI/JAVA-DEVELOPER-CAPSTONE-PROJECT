MongoDB Collection Design
ðŸ“¦ Collection Name: prescriptions
Purpose:
To store flexible, detailed prescription records associated with appointments. Each prescription can contain multiple medicines with varying instructions. This structure benefits from MongoDBâ€™s ability to handle nested and dynamic data.

Example Document (with nested fields & arrays):
{
  "_id": "presc_1001",
  "appointment_id": 45,
  "doctor_id": 7,
  "patient_id": 12,
  "issued_at": "2025-06-29T10:00:00Z",
  "notes": "Patient has mild infection. Monitor symptoms.",
  "medications": [
    {
      "name": "Amoxicillin",
      "dosage": "500mg",
      "frequency": "3 times a day",
      "duration": "7 days"
    },
    {
      "name": "Paracetamol",
      "dosage": "650mg",
      "frequency": "2 times a day",
      "duration": "5 days"
    }
  ]
}

Nested medications array:

Supports multiple medicine entries per prescription.

Each entry includes structured dosage and usage details.

Reference fields:

appointment_id, doctor_id, patient_id allow linkage to relational database records (MySQL).

Flexible schema:

Easily allows adding fields like follow_up_required, allergy_notes, or refill_info in future versions.

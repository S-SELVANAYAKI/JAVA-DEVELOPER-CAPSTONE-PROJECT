ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM OVERFLOW 

The architecture diagram represents a Spring Boot-based healthcare application that integrates both MySQL and MongoDB databases. At the top level, there are two types of modules: Dashboards (AdminDashboard and DoctorDashboard) and RESTModules (Appointments, PatientDashboard, PatientRecord). These modules interact with either Thymeleaf Controllers (for traditional HTML views) or REST Controllers (for JSON APIs). Both types of controllers communicate with a Service Layer, which acts as the central business logic handler.

The Service Layer interacts with two types of repositories:

MySQL Repositories, which access the MySQL Database via JPA Entities (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Admin). These entities are defined in the MySQLModels package.

MongoDB Repository, which accesses the MongoDB Database via a document model defined in MongoDBModels (e.g., Prescription).


SECTION 2

User accesses AdminDashboard, DoctorDashboard, Appointments, PatientDashboard, or PatientRecord pages.
The user interface is split into dashboard modules (using HTML views) and REST modules (interacting via JSON API).

The user's action is routed to either a Thymeleaf Controller or a REST Controller.
Thymeleaf Controllers handle the dashboards, while REST Controllers serve the REST modules.

The controllers forward the request to the Service Layer.
The Service Layer contains business logic and acts as a bridge between the controllers and data repositories.

The Service Layer calls the appropriate repository layer (MySQL or MongoDB) based on the data type.
It uses MySQL Repositories for structured relational data and MongoDB Repository for unstructured document-based data.

Repositories access the underlying databases.

MySQL Repositories interact with the MySQL Database using standard JPA.

MongoDB Repository accesses the MongoDB Database to retrieve or store document data.

Databases use models/entities to organize data.

MySQL uses JPA Entities like Patient, Doctor, Appointment, and Admin.

MongoDB uses Document Models such as Prescription.

The data is returned back through the layers and ultimately to the user interface.
The Service Layer processes the results and sends them to the controller, which formats and returns the response (HTML or JSON) to the user.
